3. Implement screen reader support for all screens
4. Add keyboard navigation support where applicable
5. Test with iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack
6. All accessibility labels are in Traditional Chinese

### Story 4.5: Error Handling & Edge Cases
**As a** user, **I want** graceful error handling throughout the app, **so that** I'm never left confused.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement consistent error boundaries with React Native Elements
2. Add offline state handling with clear messaging
3. Handle empty states with appropriate illustrations
4. Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
5. Ensure all error messages are user-friendly
