2. Form inputs use React Native Elements Input components with proper validation
3. Password strength indicator is implemented using React Native Elements
4. Terms and conditions checkbox uses React Native Elements CheckBox
5. All text labels and error messages are in Traditional Chinese
6. Navigation between login and registration screens works correctly

### Story 1.4: User Profile Screen Migration
**As a** logged-in user, **I want** to view and edit my profile with the new UI components, **so that** I can manage my account information effectively.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

2. Edit mode toggles properly between view and edit states
3. Form validation for profile updates remains intact
4. Success/error messages use React Native Elements overlay components
5. All profile fields are properly localized to Traditional Chinese

### Story 1.5: Password Reset Flow Migration
**As a** user who forgot my password, **I want** to reset it using the updated UI, **so that** I can regain access to my account.

2. Implement consistent error display using React Native Elements Card
3. Network error messages are user-friendly and in Traditional Chinese
4. Loading states are implemented for all async operations
5. Error boundaries are set up with fallback UI components

### Story 1.8: Component Library Documentation
**As a** developer, **I want** comprehensive documentation of the migrated components, **so that** I can maintain consistency in future development.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create a component guide documenting all migrated components
2. Include usage examples for each React Native Elements component used
