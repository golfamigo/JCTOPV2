# Animation & Micro-interactions

  * **Motion Principles**

      * **Essential & Functional First**: Animations will only be used when they serve a clear functional purpose, such as providing critical feedback or reducing cognitive load.
      * **Responsive and Performant**: All animations must be lightweight and optimized.
      * **Subtle and Consistent**: Animations will be subtle and used consistently.

  * **Key Essential Animations**

    1.  **Critical State Feedback**: Visual feedback for interactive elements (e.g., button presses).
    2.  **Essential Loading Indicators**: Spinners or skeleton screens during data fetching.
    3.  **Action Confirmation**: Feedback after a user completes an important action (e.g., a checkmark on form submission).
