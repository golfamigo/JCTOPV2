# Component Library / Design System

  * **Design System Approach**: We will **utilize and extend the existing Chakra UI component library**. Our strategy will be to use Chakra's primitives to compose our application-specific components, ensuring consistency and accelerating development.

  * **Core Components**

      * **EventCard**: To display a summary of an event in lists and grids.
      * **SearchAndFilterBar**: A composite component that combines keyword search with controls for filtering and sorting events.
      * **StepIndicator**: To visually guide users through multi-step processes like event creation or registration.
