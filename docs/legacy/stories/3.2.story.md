# Story 3.2: Registration Form - Ticket Selection

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** attendee,
**I want** to select the type and quantity of tickets I wish to purchase for an event,
**so that** I can begin the registration process.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. On the event detail page, a "Register" button initiates the registration flow.
2. The user is presented with a clear interface showing available ticket types, prices, and remaining quantities.
3. The user can select the desired quantity for each ticket type.
4. The system validates that the selected quantity does not exceed the remaining available tickets.

```

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

Component Structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// TicketTypeSelector component structure
const TicketTypeSelector = ({ eventId, onSelectionChange }) => {
  return (
    <VStack spacing={4}>
      {ticketTypes.map((ticketType) => (
        <Box key={ticketType.id} p={4} borderWidth={1} borderRadius="md">
          <HStack justify="space-between">
            <VStack align="start">
              <Text fontSize="lg" fontWeight="semibold">{ticketType.name}</Text>
              <Text color="gray.600">${ticketType.price}</Text>
              <Text fontSize="sm" color="gray.500">
                {ticketType.availableQuantity} remaining
              </Text>
            </VStack>
            <QuantityPicker
              max={ticketType.availableQuantity}
              onChange={(qty) => handleQuantityChange(ticketType.id, qty)}
            />
          </HStack>
        </Box>
      ))}
    </VStack>
  );
};
```

Service Layer [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// ticketService extension
export const ticketService = {
  async getTicketTypesWithAvailability(eventId: string): Promise<TicketTypeWithAvailability[]> {
    const response = await apiClient.get(`/events/${eventId}/ticket-types`);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  async validateTicketSelection(eventId: string, selections: TicketSelection[]): Promise<boolean> {
    const response = await apiClient.post(`/events/${eventId}/validate-selection`, { selections });
    return response.data.valid;
  }
};
```

### UI/UX Requirements

Component Design [Source: docs/UIUX/component-library-design-system.md]:
- Use Chakra UI components as foundation
- Extend with custom styling following design system
- Create reusable ticket selection components

Color Palette [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Primary #2563EB: Main buttons, Register button, quantity controls
- Secondary #475569: Secondary text, borders, UI accents  
- Success #10B981: Available quantity indicators
- Error #EF4444: Sold out warnings, validation errors
- Neutral colors (#F8FAFC, #E2E8F0, #64748B, #0F172A): Backgrounds, borders, text

Typography [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Font families: Inter for Latin, Noto Sans TC for Traditional Chinese
- H3: 24px Semi-Bold (600), Line height 1.3 for ticket type names
- Body: 16px Normal (400), Line height 1.5 for prices and descriptions
- Small: 14px Normal (400), Line height 1.5 for availability counts

Layout & Spacing [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Follow 4-pixel grid system
- Use Feather Icons for consistent iconography (plus/minus for quantity)

Responsiveness [Source: docs/UIUX/responsiveness-strategy.md]:
- Mobile (320px): Single column layout, full-width ticket cards
- Tablet (768px): Two-column layout for ticket types
- Desktop (1024px): Optimized layout with enhanced spacing
- Wide (1440px): Enhanced layout with more detailed information

Accessibility [Source: docs/UIUX/accessibility-requirements.md]:
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance required
- Proper ARIA labels for ticket selection and quantity controls
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility for price and availability information
- High contrast ratios for text and background
- Focus indicators for all form elements
- Clear error messages for validation feedback

### Registration Flow Context

User Flow Integration [Source: docs/UIUX/user-flows.md]:
This story implements step H in the attendee registration flow:
```
F[Views Event Details Page] → G[Clicks "Register"] → H[Selects Ticket Type & Quantity]
```

Step Indicator Component [Source: docs/UIUX/component-library-design-system.md]:
- Use StepIndicator component for multi-step registration process
- This is Step 1: Ticket Selection
- Future steps: Registration Form, Payment

### API Client Pattern

Service Layer Integration [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Frontend must only interact with API through service layer
- Use shared types from packages/shared-types  
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

### Testing Requirements

Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests for individual functions/methods  
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Follow testing pyramid (more unit, fewer E2E)

Frontend Testing:
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Test TicketTypeSelector rendering with different availability states
- Test TicketQuantityPicker validation and user interactions
- Test RegistrationStepOne integration and navigation
- Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- Mock API service calls in tests

### Coding Standards

Critical Rules [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use shared types from packages/shared-types
- Frontend API calls only through service layer
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Maintain type safety throughout
- Follow UI/UX guidelines from docs/UIUX

### Technical Constraints

Frontend Performance:
- Implement proper loading states for ticket availability checks
- Use optimistic updates for better user experience  
- Validate selections client-side before proceeding
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Show real-time availability updates

Database Considerations:
- Handle concurrent ticket purchases gracefully
- Implement proper validation for quantity limits
- Consider race conditions for popular events

### Security Considerations

Input Validation:
- Validate quantity selections are within available limits
- Validate ticket type IDs exist for the event
- Prevent negative quantities or invalid selections

Rate Limiting:
- Consider rate limiting for ticket availability checks
- Implement reasonable limits for quantity selection

Authorization:
- Ensure users can only select tickets for published events
- Validate event accessibility before showing ticket options

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Test File Locations [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Frontend: Same directory as component with .spec.tsx extension

Testing Frameworks:
- Frontend: Jest & React Testing Library for component tests

Testing Patterns:
- Mock external dependencies
- Test happy path and error cases
- Test edge cases and validation
- Ensure proper test isolation

Specific Testing Requirements:
- Test TicketTypeSelector with various availability scenarios (sold out, limited, unlimited)
- Test TicketQuantityPicker with quantity limits and validation
- Test RegistrationStepOne navigation and state management
- Test responsive behavior at breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Test accessibility compliance for all interactive elements
- Test error handling for network failures and validation errors
- Test API service methods with mocked responses
