# Story 4.3: Manual Attendee Search & Check-in

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** event organizer,
**I want** a manual lookup option,
**so that** I can check in attendees who may have forgotten or are unable to display their QR code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Within the "Check-in Mode", there is an option to search for attendees manually.
2. The organizer can search by name or registration number.
3. The search results display matching attendees and their current check-in status.
4. The organizer can select an attendee from the search results and manually mark them as "checked-in".

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.2 completion: QR code scanning and validation fully implemented. Key components established:
- CheckInModeScreen: `apps/client/src/components/features/organizer/CheckInModeScreen.tsx`
- CheckIn service: `apps/client/src/services/checkinService.ts` 
- CheckIn API endpoint: POST /api/v1/events/{eventId}/checkin
- Success/Error modals: CheckInSuccessModal and CheckInErrorModal components
- Real-time statistics updates in check-in mode interface

The manual search feature will extend the existing check-in infrastructure with search capabilities.

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: docs/UIUX - must follow all guides]
- Use Chakra UI components for search form and results display
- Follow responsive design patterns for mobile check-in operations
- Implement accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Apply consistent branding and style guide
- Use proper loading states during search operations
- Provide clear visual feedback for search results and check-in status
- Ensure search interface is optimized for quick venue operations
- Follow design patterns from existing check-in modals for consistency

### Technical Constraints
- Search operations must be fast (under 300ms response time)
- Support partial name matching with case-insensitive search
- Handle large attendee lists with proper pagination
- Prevent duplicate manual check-ins (same validation as QR scanning)
- Maintain audit trail for both QR and manual check-ins
- Search interface must work efficiently in venue lighting conditions
- Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing

### External Dependencies Required
- Existing Chakra UI components for forms and lists
- Backend: JWT authentication for secure API access (already implemented)
- TypeORM query builder for efficient search operations

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files location: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts/.spec.tsx extension
- Frontend: Use Jest & React Testing Library for component tests
- Backend: Use Jest & Supertest for API endpoint tests
- Mock search operations and attendee data for testing
- Test all search scenarios (name, registration ID, partial matches)
- Test pagination and large result sets
- Test error states and network failure scenarios
- Test UI accessibility with screen readers

### Test Scenarios
- Valid search with multiple results
- Search with no results found
- Partial name matching functionality
- Registration ID search
- Manual check-in of found attendee
- Attempt to manually check-in already checked-in attendee
- Search with network connectivity issues
- Large result set pagination
- UI component interactions and accessibility

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-02
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent Overall Implementation** - The manual attendee search and check-in feature is well-architected with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and good user experience design. The implementation follows React and NestJS best practices with proper TypeScript usage throughout.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/events/services/attendee-search.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive input validation, improved query performance with query cloning, added secondary sorting for consistency, and enhanced error handling
  - **Why**: Original implementation lacked proper input validation and could have performance issues with large datasets
  - **How**: Validates all inputs, uses query builder cloning to avoid pagination interference on count queries, adds secondary sort for consistent ordering

- **File**: `apps/client/src/services/attendeeSearchService.ts`
  - **Change**: Implemented intelligent caching with TTL, enhanced error handling, and added input validation
  - **Why**: Improves performance by caching search results and provides better error messages for debugging
  - **How**: Uses Map-based cache with 30-second TTL, automatic cleanup of expired entries, and cache invalidation after check-in operations

- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/events/dto/attendee-search.dto.ts`
  - **Change**: Added input validation in DTO constructor with null-safe property access
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors from malformed data and provides better error messages
  - **How**: Validates required fields exist before accessing properties, provides fallback values for optional fields

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows TypeScript best practices, proper error handling, and clean code principles
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect** - All files placed correctly according to project structure guidelines
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Unit tests cover all scenarios including edge cases and error conditions
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Complete** - All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Enhanced backend service with proper input validation and performance optimizations
- [x] Added intelligent caching to frontend service with automatic cleanup
- [x] Improved error handling throughout the stack
- [x] Added null-safe DTO construction with validation
- [x] Optimized database queries with proper indexing considerations
- [x] Implemented cache invalidation strategy for data consistency

### Security Review
**Excellent Security Implementation** - Proper JWT authentication on API endpoints, input sanitization for search queries, access control validation (event ownership), and no sensitive data exposure in error messages. Search query length limits prevent potential DoS attacks.

### Performance Considerations
**Well Optimized** - Intelligent caching reduces API calls, database queries use proper indexing, pagination implemented correctly, and query builder optimizations prevent N+1 queries. Search operations should easily meet the <300ms requirement specified in technical constraints.

### Architecture & Design Patterns
**Excellent Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns with dedicated search service, consistent error handling patterns, singleton pattern for frontend service, and proper dependency injection in backend. Component composition follows React best practices.

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done** - This is production-ready code with excellent quality, comprehensive testing, and proper architecture. All acceptance criteria met with significant quality improvements applied during review.
