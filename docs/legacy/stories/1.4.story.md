# Story 1.4: Email & Password Registration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to register for an account using my email and a password,
**so that** I can access the platform's features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A registration form with "Name", "Email", and "Password" fields is available.
2. The registration API endpoint validates input (e.g., email format, password strength).
3. The API checks for existing users to prevent duplicate emails.
4. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.
5. A new user record is created in the `users` table upon successful registration.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion: PostgreSQL database connection is established and working with TypeORM configuration. User entity and database migration are complete. Database connection string format is confirmed: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/jctop_event`. NestJS backend (~10.3) has features-based module structure with TypeORM repository pattern established. User table exists with UUID primary keys and proper indexes.

### Tech Stack Requirements
Technologies [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Frontend**: TypeScript ~5.5, Expo (React Native) ~51.0, Chakra UI ~2.8, Zustand ~4.5
- **Backend**: TypeScript ~5.5, NestJS ~10.3, Passport.js ~0.7 for authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with existing User table from Story 1.3
- **Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7 (frontend), Jest & Supertest ~29.7 (backend)

### Data Models
User Interface [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  authProvider: 'email' | 'google' | 'line' | 'apple';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

User Relationships [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- A **User** can have many **Registrations**
- A **User** (as an organizer) can create many **Events**

### File Locations

```

### Backend Architecture
Repository Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './entities/user.entity';
import { CreateUserDto } from './dto/create-user.dto';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private usersRepository: Repository<User>,
  ) {}

  async register(createUserDto: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> {
    // Hash password before saving
    const user = this.usersRepository.create(createUserDto);
    return this.usersRepository.save(user);
  }
}
```

### Frontend Architecture
Component Template [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

type RegisterFormProps = {
  onRegister: (userData: RegisterData) => void;
};

const RegisterForm = ({ onRegister }: RegisterFormProps) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* Form implementation */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default RegisterForm;
```

API Service Pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// src/services/authService.ts
import apiClient from './apiClient';
import { User } from '../../packages/shared-types';

export const registerUser = async (userData: RegisterData): Promise<User> => {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/auth/register', userData);
  return response.data;
};
```

### Technical Constraints
Authentication Requirements:
- Must use Passport.js ~0.7 for authentication middleware
- Passwords must be securely hashed (use bcrypt)
- Email must be unique in database (constraint already exists from Story 1.3)
- Must use existing User entity from Story 1.3
- authProvider field should be set to 'email' for email registration
- Follow NestJS controller/service pattern from backend architecture
- Frontend must use service layer pattern for API calls

### Coding Standards
Critical Rules [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Type Sharing**: Use existing User interface from `packages/shared-types`
- **API Calls**: Frontend must interact with API through dedicated service layer (`src/services`)
- **Environment Variables**: Access environment variables only through dedicated configuration module
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use standard error handling middleware

### Testing
Unit Tests Required [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Backend Tests**: Registration endpoint validation, password hashing, email uniqueness, user creation
- **Frontend Tests**: RegisterForm component interactions, form validation, authService calls
- **Integration Tests**: Complete registration flow from form submission to database record creation

Testing Strategy follows pyramid approach: Unit > Integration > E2E

Test File Locations:
- `apps/server/src/features/auth/auth.service.spec.ts` - Auth service unit tests
- `apps/server/src/features/auth/auth.controller.spec.ts` - Auth controller unit tests
- `apps/client/src/components/features/auth/RegisterForm.spec.tsx` - Registration form tests
- `apps/client/src/services/authService.spec.ts` - Auth service tests

### Environment Configuration
API Configuration:
```bash
# Backend (apps/server/.env) - existing from previous stories
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/jctop_event"

# Frontend (apps/client/.env)
API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/v1"
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-30
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation follows solid software engineering practices with proper separation of concerns. The code architecture adheres to the established patterns from Dev Notes, using NestJS features-based module structure on the backend and service layer pattern on the frontend. TypeScript types are properly defined and shared between frontend and backend as required.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: apps/client/src/services/apiClient.ts
  - **Change**: Added environment variable support for API base URL
  - **Why**: Hardcoded URLs are not production-ready and violate environment variable best practices
  - **How**: Uses `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` with fallback to localhost for development

- **File**: apps/client/src/services/apiClient.ts  
  - **Change**: Improved error handling in handleResponse method
  - **Why**: Original implementation had weak error handling that could fail silently
  - **How**: Added proper JSON parsing error handling and more descriptive error messages

- **File**: apps/client/src/services/authService.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling with proper error re-throwing
  - **Why**: Provides better debugging and user experience with specific error messages
  - **How**: Wrapped API calls in try-catch with proper error message handling

- **File**: apps/server/src/features/auth/dto/register-user.dto.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced validation decorators with length limits and improved regex
  - **Why**: Original validation was insufficient for production security requirements  
  - **How**: Added MinLength/MaxLength constraints and strengthened password regex pattern

- **File**: apps/client/src/components/features/auth/RegisterForm.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated frontend validation to match backend requirements
  - **Why**: Frontend and backend validation should be consistent to prevent confusion
  - **How**: Added length validation for all fields and updated error messages

- **File**: apps/client/src/components/features/auth/RegisterForm.spec.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated test expectations to match new validation messages
  - **Why**: Tests must match actual implementation behavior
  - **How**: Updated assertion strings to match refactored validation messages
