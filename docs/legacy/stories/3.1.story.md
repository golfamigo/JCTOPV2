### Backend Architecture Patterns

Controller Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
@Controller('events/:eventId/discount-codes')
export class DiscountCodesController {
  @Post()
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  async create(
    @Param('eventId') eventId: string,
    @Body() createDiscountCodeDto: CreateDiscountCodeDto,
    @User() user: any
  ) {
    return this.discountCodesService.create(eventId, createDiscountCodeDto, user.id);
  }
}
```

Service Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use Repository pattern with TypeORM
- Validate event ownership before allowing discount code operations
- Include proper error handling for validation failures
- Track usage statistics when codes are applied during registration

Usage Tracking Implementation:
- Increment usage count during registration process in RegistrationService
- Use database transaction to ensure atomicity when applying discount and incrementing count
- Check discount code validity (not expired, event match) before incrementing
- Return error if discount code has reached usage limit (if implemented)
```typescript
// In RegistrationService during checkout
async applyDiscountCode(eventId: string, code: string, amount: number) {
  const discount = await this.discountCodeRepository.findOne({ 
    where: { eventId, code } 
  });
  
  if (!discount || discount.expiresAt < new Date()) {
    throw new BadRequestException('Invalid or expired discount code');
  }
  
  // Calculate discounted amount
  const discountedAmount = this.calculateDiscount(amount, discount);
  
  // Increment usage count in transaction with registration creation
  await this.discountCodeRepository.increment(
    { id: discount.id }, 
    'usageCount', 
    1
  );
  
  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

Component Structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// DiscountCodeForm component structure
const DiscountCodeForm = ({ eventId, onSubmit, initialData }) => {
  return (
    <Box>
      <FormControl isRequired>
        <FormLabel>Discount Code</FormLabel>
        <Input placeholder="Enter code name" />
      </FormControl>
      <FormControl isRequired>
        <FormLabel>Type</FormLabel>
        <Select placeholder="Select discount type">
          <option value="percentage">Percentage</option>
          <option value="fixed_amount">Fixed Amount</option>
        </Select>
      </FormControl>
      <FormControl isRequired>
        <FormLabel>Value</FormLabel>
        <NumberInput>
          <NumberInputField />
        </NumberInput>
      </FormControl>
      <FormControl>
        <FormLabel>Expiration Date</FormLabel>
        <Input type="datetime-local" />
      </FormControl>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

Service Layer [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// discountCodeService
export const discountCodeService = {
  async createDiscountCode(eventId: string, data: CreateDiscountCodeDto): Promise<DiscountCodeResponse> {
    const response = await apiClient.post(`/events/${eventId}/discount-codes`, data);
    return response.data;
  },
  
  async getDiscountCodes(eventId: string): Promise<DiscountCodeResponse[]> {
    const response = await apiClient.get(`/events/${eventId}/discount-codes`);
    return response.data;
  }
};
```

### UI/UX Requirements

Component Design [Source: docs/UIUX/component-library-design-system.md]:
- Use Chakra UI components as foundation
- Extend with custom styling following design system
- Create reusable discount code management components

Color Palette [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Primary #2563EB: Main buttons, create/save actions
- Secondary #475569: Secondary text, borders, UI accents  
- Success #10B981: Positive feedback, successful creation
- Error #EF4444: Validation errors, deletion confirmations
- Neutral colors (#F8FAFC, #E2E8F0, #64748B, #0F172A): Backgrounds, borders, text

Typography [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Font families: Inter for Latin, Noto Sans TC for Traditional Chinese
- H3: 24px Semi-Bold (600), Line height 1.3 for section headers
- Body: 16px Normal (400), Line height 1.5 for form labels and content
- Small: 14px Normal (400), Line height 1.5 for usage statistics

Layout & Spacing [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Follow 4-pixel grid system
- Use Feather Icons for consistent iconography (edit, delete, copy actions)

Responsiveness [Source: docs/UIUX/responsiveness-strategy.md]:
- Mobile (320px): Single column layout, full-width forms
- Tablet (768px): Two-column layout for form and list
- Desktop (1024px): Optimized layout with sidebar or tabs
- Wide (1440px): Enhanced layout with more detailed statistics

Accessibility [Source: docs/UIUX/accessibility-requirements.md]:
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance required
- Proper ARIA labels for form inputs and action buttons
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility for usage statistics
- High contrast ratios for text and background
- Focus indicators for all form elements
- Clear error messages and validation feedback

### API Client Pattern

Service Layer Integration [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Frontend must only interact with API through service layer
- Use shared types from packages/shared-types
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

### Testing Requirements

Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests for individual functions/methods  
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Follow testing pyramid (more unit, fewer E2E)

Backend Testing:
- Test files in same directory with .spec.ts extension
- Use Jest and Supertest for API testing
- Test discount code CRUD operations
- Test event ownership validation
- Test usage tracking functionality
- Mock database interactions appropriately

Frontend Testing:
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Test DiscountCodeForm validation and submission
- Test DiscountCodeList rendering and interactions
- Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints
- Test accessibility features
- Mock API service calls in tests

### Coding Standards

Critical Rules [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Use shared types from packages/shared-types
- Frontend API calls only through service layer
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Maintain type safety throughout
- Follow UI/UX guidelines from docs/UIUX

### Technical Constraints

API Design:
- Follow RESTful principles for discount code management
- Validate event ownership before allowing operations
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide clear error messages for validation failures

Database:
- Enforce unique constraint on (event_id, code) combination
- Handle cascade deletion when events are removed
- Consider indexing on event_id for performance

Frontend Performance:
- Implement proper loading states for API calls
- Use optimistic updates for better user experience
- Validate forms client-side before submission
- Handle network errors gracefully

### Security Considerations

Code Generation:
- Use cryptographically secure random string generation for discount codes
- Minimum 8 characters with alphanumeric characters (uppercase)
- Example: crypto.randomBytes(6).toString('hex').toUpperCase()

Rate Limiting:
- Implement rate limiting on discount code creation (max 100 per event per hour)
- Implement rate limiting on discount code validation attempts (max 10 per minute per IP)

Audit Logging:
- Log all discount code creation with organizer ID and timestamp
- Log all discount code usage with user ID, event ID, and timestamp
- Store audit logs for compliance and tracking

Authorization:
- Only event organizers can create/modify/delete discount codes for their events
- Validate JWT token and event ownership on all discount code endpoints
- Use @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, EventOwnershipGuard) on controller methods

Input Validation:
- Sanitize discount code input to prevent injection attacks
- Validate discount value ranges (percentage: 1-100, fixed: > 0)
- Validate expiration dates are in the future when creating

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Test File Locations [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Backend: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts extension
- Frontend: Same directory as component with .spec.tsx extension

Testing Frameworks:

- Frontend: Jest & React Testing Library for component tests

Testing Patterns:
- Mock external dependencies
- Test happy path and error cases
- Test edge cases and validation
- Ensure proper test isolation
