# Story 3.6: Attendee Management for Organizers

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** event organizer,
**I want** to view and manage the list of attendees for my event,
**so that** I can track registration progress and have a record of participants.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.5 completion: Registration system fully implemented with QR code generation and email confirmation. Registration entity includes payment status tracking and user information. Key files established:
- Registration entities and services: `apps/server/src/features/registrations/`
- User dashboard components: `apps/client/src/components/features/user/`
- Payment status tracking: Status field in Registration entity with values 'pending', 'paid', 'cancelled', 'checkedIn'

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Backend: TypeScript ~5.5, NestJS ~10.3, TypeORM ~0.3, PostgreSQL 16
- Frontend: TypeScript ~5.5, Expo (React Native) ~51.0, Chakra UI ~2.8, Zustand ~4.5
- Testing: Jest & Supertest ~29.7 (backend), Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7 (frontend)
- **CRITICAL**: Frontend must follow all guides in docs/UIUX directory

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

Registration Entity (existing):
```typescript
interface Registration {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  eventId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'cancelled' | 'checkedIn';
  qrCode: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

User Entity (existing):
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  authProvider: 'email' | 'google' | 'line' | 'apple';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Event Entity (existing):
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  organizerId: string;
  categoryId: string;
  venueId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  location: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'ended' | 'paused';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Database Schema Information
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Registrations table exists with foreign keys to users and events
- Users table contains attendee contact information
- Events table contains event details with organizer ownership
- Indexes exist on event_id and user_id for efficient querying

### Project Structure

│           └── [eventId]/
│               └── attendees.tsx (to create)
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
No existing API endpoints for attendee management found. Will need to create:
- GET /api/v1/events/{eventId}/attendees?status={status}&search={term} (fetch filtered attendee list)
- GET /api/v1/events/{eventId}/attendees/export?format={csv|excel} (export attendee data)

### Authorization Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Must use JWT authentication for organizer access
- Must verify that the requesting user is the organizer of the event
- Implement proper authorization guards to prevent data leakage between organizers

### External Dependencies
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- No external APIs required for this story
- Export functionality will be handled server-side with native Node.js libraries

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: docs/UIUX - must follow all guides]
- Use Chakra UI components as foundation for attendee management interface
- Follow responsive design patterns for mobile/tablet/desktop viewing
- Implement accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Apply consistent branding and style guide
- Consider performance optimizations for large attendee lists
- Use proper loading states and error handling patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Attendee list should be paginated for events with many registrations
- Export functionality should handle large datasets efficiently
- Filtering and search should be implemented server-side for performance
- Data should be real-time or near real-time to reflect current registration status
- Must maintain data privacy - only show attendee data to the event organizer

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files location: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts/.spec.tsx extension
- Backend: Use Jest & Supertest for unit and integration tests
- Frontend: Use Jest & React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external dependencies and database queries appropriately
- Test authorization scenarios to ensure data isolation between organizers
- Test edge cases like empty attendee lists and large datasets
