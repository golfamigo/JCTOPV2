## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.3 completion: CheckInModeScreen already exists with tabbed interface and established check-in infrastructure:
- CheckInModeScreen: `apps/client/src/components/features/organizer/CheckInModeScreen.tsx`
- CheckIn service: `apps/client/src/services/checkinService.ts`
- CheckIn API endpoint: POST /api/v1/events/{eventId}/checkin
- Real-time statistics updates are mentioned as already implemented in check-in mode interface
- Success/Error modals and feedback systems are established

This story will extend the existing infrastructure to display and manage real-time statistics.

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: docs/UIUX - must follow all guides]
- Use Chakra UI components for statistics display
- Follow branded color palette from branding-style-guide.md:
  - Primary: #2563EB (main buttons, active elements)
  - Success: #10B981 (positive statistics, high attendance rates)
  - Warning: #FBBF24 (medium attendance rates)
  - Error: #EF4444 (low attendance rates)
  - Neutral: #F8FAFC, #E2E8F0, #64748B, #0F172A (backgrounds, borders, text)
- Typography: Use Inter font family for Latin characters/numbers
- 4-pixel grid system for spacing and layout
- Follow responsive design patterns for mobile check-in operations
- Implement accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Use Feather Icons for consistent iconography
- Apply loading states during statistics refresh
- Provide clear visual feedback for real-time updates

### Technical Constraints
- Statistics updates must be performant (under 500ms response time)
- Real-time updates should balance frequency with performance (recommended: 5-10 second intervals)
- Handle large events with thousands of attendees efficiently
- Statistics must be accurate and consistent across check-in mode and dashboard
- Implement proper caching to avoid database overload
- Support offline/poor connectivity scenarios with cached data
- Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing
- Security: Only event organizers can access their event statistics

### State Management Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Extend eventStore to include statistics state management
- Use Zustand patterns for real-time data updates
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Cache statistics data to reduce API calls

### External Dependencies Required
- Existing Chakra UI components for statistics cards and counters
- Backend: JWT authentication for secure API access (already implemented)
- TypeORM query builder for efficient statistics calculations
- Potential WebSocket implementation for real-time updates (or polling fallback)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files location: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts/.spec.tsx extension
- Frontend: Use Jest & React Testing Library for component tests
- Backend: Use Jest & Supertest for API endpoint tests
- Follow testing pyramid: unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- Mock statistics data and API calls for testing
- Test all loading states and error scenarios
- Test real-time update functionality
- Test UI accessibility with screen readers

### Test Scenarios
- Valid statistics request returns correct data
- Statistics display updates in real-time during check-ins
- Dashboard shows accurate statistics across multiple events
- Proper error handling when event not found
- Access control: only organizers can view their event statistics
- Performance testing with large attendee lists
- UI component interactions and accessibility
- Network connectivity issues and fallback behavior
- Statistics caching and refresh functionality

### Status
Ready for Review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-02
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Overall implementation quality is **good** with solid architecture following NestJS and React/Chakra UI patterns. The developer correctly implemented the backend API with proper service architecture, frontend components with state management, and comprehensive test coverage. The code demonstrates good understanding of TypeScript, error handling, and modern React patterns.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/events/services/event-statistics.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced generic `Error` with `NotFoundException` from NestJS for proper HTTP error responses
  - **Why**: NestJS automatically converts `NotFoundException` to HTTP 404 responses, providing better API consistency
  - **How**: Improves error handling by using framework-specific exceptions that integrate with NestJS filters

- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/events/services/event-statistics.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeORM query syntax using `In()` operator instead of array cast
  - **Why**: The original `status: ['paid', 'checkedIn'] as any` bypassed TypeScript safety
  - **How**: Using proper `In(['paid', 'checkedIn'])` provides type safety and correct SQL generation

- **File**: `apps/client/src/services/statisticsService.ts`
  - **Change**: Added environment variable support for API URL configuration
  - **Why**: Hardcoded localhost URL would fail in production environments
  - **How**: Uses `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` with localhost fallback for development

- **File**: `apps/client/src/services/statisticsService.ts`
  - **Change**: Implemented request timeout with AbortController and enhanced error handling
  - **Why**: Prevents hanging requests and provides better user feedback for network issues
  - **How**: Adds 10-second timeout and specific handling for timeout/abort errors

- **File**: `apps/client/src/components/features/organizer/CheckInStatisticsHeader.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added safety checks for percentage calculations when total registrations is 0
  - **Why**: Prevents display of NaN or undefined percentages in edge cases
  - **How**: Conditional rendering showing '0.0%' or '100.0%' when totalRegistrations is 0

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows TypeScript best practices, proper error handling, and clean code principles
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files placed correctly according to unified project structure guidelines
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests following Jest patterns
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Both acceptance criteria fully implemented with real-time statistics and dashboard integration

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Enhanced backend error handling with proper NestJS exceptions
- [x] Fixed TypeORM query syntax for type safety
- [x] Added environment configuration support for API URLs
- [x] Implemented request timeout and enhanced error handling
- [x] Added edge case protection for percentage calculations
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage exists
- [ ] Consider adding database indexing documentation for performance optimization
- [ ] Consider adding metrics/monitoring integration for production statistics endpoint usage

### Security Review
✓ **Passed** - Authentication properly implemented using JWT tokens, authorization verified through `findEventByIdForUser` to ensure users can only access their own event statistics. No sensitive data exposure in error messages.

### Performance Considerations
✓ **Good** - Implemented caching strategy with 30-second cache duration, request timeouts to prevent hanging, and optimized database queries using count operations. The polling mechanism balances real-time updates with performance.

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

Story implementation meets all acceptance criteria with high code quality. Refactoring improvements enhance error handling, type safety, configuration management, and edge case handling. Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability. The implementation follows architectural patterns and includes proper security measures.
