# Introduction

[cite\_start]This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the JCTOP EVENT platform, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. [cite: 881] [cite\_start]It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. [cite: 881] [cite\_start]This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined. [cite: 882]

### Starter Template or Existing Project

  * **Recommendation**: Use a **Turborepo starter template**. Specifically, one configured for an Expo application and a standard Node.js (e.g., Express or Fastify) backend service.
  * **Rationale**: This aligns perfectly with the "Monorepo" technical assumption in the PRD. Turborepo is highly efficient for managing monorepos, and using a pre-configured starter will save significant time in setting up build tooling, shared TypeScript configurations, and deployment pipelines.
