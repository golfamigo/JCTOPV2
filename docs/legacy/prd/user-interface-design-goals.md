# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be seamless, intuitive, and efficient. For attendees, the platform must make discovering and registering for events effortless. For organizers, the interface should be powerful yet straightforward, simplifying complex tasks like event and registration management into a guided, frustration-free process. The design should be clean, modern, and trustworthy to handle transactions confidently.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Card-Based Browse:** Events will be presented in visually scannable cards for quick discovery.
* **Faceted Search & Filtering:** Users will employ powerful, easy-to-use filters and sorting to quickly find relevant events.
* **Wizard-Style Creation Flows:** Organizers will be guided through complex processes like event creation via a step-by-step interface.
* **Dashboard-Centric Management:** Both organizers and attendees will have centralized dashboards to manage their activities (e.g., "My Tickets," "Event Dashboard").

### Core Screens and Views
* Home/Event Discovery Page
* Event Details Page
* User Login / Registration Screen
