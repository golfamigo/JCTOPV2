# Performance Considerations

  * **Performance Goals**

      * **Page Load**: Core pages must load within 3 seconds.
      * **Interaction Response**: Key API interactions should feel instantaneous (under 500ms).
      * **Animation FPS**: All essential animations must maintain a smooth 60 frames per second (FPS).

  * **Design Strategies**: We will use image optimization, lazy loading of content, and skeleton screens to manage perceived wait times.
