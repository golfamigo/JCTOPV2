## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 4.7 completion notes]
- Story 4.7 successfully completed comprehensive testing with 80%+ coverage
- Test infrastructure supports both web and native environments
- Created testing best practices documentation (docs/testing-best-practices.md)
- UAT test plan documented (docs/uat-test-plan.md)
- Known issues documented (docs/known-issues.md)
- All tests passing with React Native Elements components

### Documentation Structure
[Source: docs/README.md]
Current documentation organization:
- `/docs/current/` - Current version docs (React Native Elements)
- `/docs/legacy/` - Archived Gluestack UI docs
- `/docs/migration/` - Migration process documentation
- `/docs/stories/` - User story documents
- `/docs/frontend/` - Frontend specific documentation

### Tech Stack Documentation Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-技術棧對齊-tech-stack-alignment.md]

Key technologies to document:
- **UI Framework**: `@rneui/base` & `@rneui/themed` (latest stable)
- **Icons**: `@expo/vector-icons` (must use `npx expo install`)
- **Localization**: `i18next` & `react-i18next` (latest stable)
- **Platform**: Expo SDK 53
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **API Client**: Axios

### Component Architecture to Document
[Source: architecture/5-元件架構-component-architecture.md]

Atomic Design structure:
```
apps/client/src/components/
├── atoms/      (基礎元件)
├── molecules/  (組合元件)
└── organisms/  (複雜元件)
```

Component hierarchy must be documented with examples showing the relationship between atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages.

### File Structure Guidelines
[Source: architecture/6-源碼樹整合-source-tree-integration.md]

Document the following structure and guidelines:
```
apps/client/src/
├── components/   (可複用元件)
├── theme/       (主題配置)
│   └── index.ts
├── localization/ (多語言設定)
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── locales/
│       └── zh-TW.json
```

Integration rules to document:
1. Screens must use reusable components from `components/`
2. All styles must use `theme/index.ts` (no hardcoding)
3. All static text must use i18n functions (no hardcoding)

### System Integration Principles
[Source: architecture/7-系統整合遵循原則-system-integration-adherence.md]

Documentation must emphasize:
- **Deployment**: No changes to existing CI/CD processes
- **Standards**: New code must pass existing Linter and Formatter checks
- **Testing**: New components must use existing test framework

### Frontend Specification Requirements
[Source: docs/current/front-end-spec.md]

Key aspects to document:
- **Color Palette**: Primary (#007BFF), White (#FFFFFF), Light Grey (#F8F9FA), etc.
- **Typography**: System fonts (PingFang TC for iOS, Noto Sans CJK TC for Android)
- **Spacing**: 8pt grid system
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile (<768px), Tablet (≥768px), Desktop (≥1200px)
- **Localization**: Traditional Chinese throughout

### Existing Documentation to Update
- docs/README.md - Already contains navigation structure
- docs/migration/migration-log.md - Needs final completion status
- docs/migration/compatibility-checklist.md - Needs completion
- Main project README.md - Does not exist, needs creation

### Documentation Deliverables Location
All documentation should be created in appropriate locations:
- Main README.md → Project root
- Migration guide → docs/migration/migration-guide.md
- Component mapping → docs/migration/component-mapping.md
- Style guide → docs/frontend/react-native-elements-style-guide.md
- Localization guide → docs/frontend/localization-guide.md
- Deployment checklist → docs/deployment-checklist.md
- Developer onboarding → docs/developer-onboarding.md

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
[Source: architecture/7-系統整合遵循原則-system-integration-adherence.md]
- Documentation must be reviewed for technical accuracy
- All code examples must be tested and verified
- Links and references must be validated
- Documentation must follow existing project documentation standards
