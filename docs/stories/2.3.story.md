### Backend Architecture Patterns

Controller Extension [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
@Controller('events')
export class EventsController {
  @Post(':eventId/ticket-types')
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  async createTicketType(
    @Param('eventId') eventId: string,
    @Body() createTicketTypeDto: CreateTicketTypeDto,
    @Request() req
  ) {
    // Verify event ownership before creating
    return this.eventsService.createTicketType(eventId, createTicketTypeDto, req.user.id);
  }
}
```

Service Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use Repository pattern with TypeORM
- Inject repositories for TicketType and SeatingZone
- Verify event ownership in all operations
- Handle related entity operations transactionally

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

Component Structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// Multi-step form integration
const EventCreateForm = () => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
  const [ticketTypes, setTicketTypes] = useState<TicketType[]>([]);
  const [seatingZones, setSeatingZones] = useState<SeatingZone[]>([]);
  
  // Step 2: Ticket & Seating Configuration
  if (currentStep === 2) {
    return (
      <>
        <TicketConfiguration 
          ticketTypes={ticketTypes}
          onChange={setTicketTypes}
        />
        <SeatingConfiguration
          seatingZones={seatingZones}
          onChange={setSeatingZones}
        />
      </>
    );
  }
};
```

State Management [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
- Use local component state for form data during creation
- Only persist to backend when moving between steps or saving
- Use Zustand for any global state needs

### UI/UX Requirements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-31
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Overall Grade: A-** - Excellent implementation with comprehensive feature coverage. The code follows established patterns, has good separation of concerns, and includes thorough validation and error handling. Architecture is solid with proper TypeScript usage throughout. Two critical security/type safety issues were identified and corrected during review.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: apps/server/src/entities/seating-zone.entity.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed type safety issue - changed `description: string` to `description?: string` to match nullable database column
  - **Why**: The database column was marked as `nullable: true` but TypeScript type wasn't optional, creating a type safety violation
  - **How**: This prevents runtime errors and maintains type consistency between database schema and TypeScript types

- **File**: apps/server/src/features/events/events.controller.ts
  - **Change**: Added authorization checks to GET endpoints for ticket-types and seating-zones
  - **Why**: Critical security vulnerability - any authenticated user could view ticket/seating data for any event
  - **How**: Added userId parameter from JWT token to ensure only event owners can access their event data

- **File**: apps/server/src/features/events/events.service.ts
  - **Change**: Updated getTicketTypes() and getSeatingZones() methods to include ownership verification
  - **Why**: Enforces authorization at service layer to prevent unauthorized data access
  - **How**: Uses existing verifyEventOwnership() method to ensure consistent security across all operations

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to TypeScript best practices, proper naming conventions, and consistent code structure
- **Project Structure**: ✓ All files correctly placed following established architecture patterns and directory structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit tests for DTOs, services, and components. Edge cases well covered
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented with proper validation and user experience

### Architecture & Design Review
**Strengths:**
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation between controllers, services, entities, and DTOs
- **Type Safety**: Excellent use of shared types ensuring consistency across frontend/backend
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with proper error messages and user feedback
- **Security**: JWT authentication with ownership verification (after fixes)
- **UX/UI**: Outstanding Chakra UI implementation with accessibility compliance and responsive design
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns with meaningful user feedback

**Areas of Excellence:**
- Multi-step form implementation with proper state management
- Real-time validation with immediate user feedback  
- Comprehensive frontend validation matching backend constraints
- Excellent accessibility implementation (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design following 4-pixel grid system
- Professional UI with proper color scheme and spacing

### Security Review
- **FIXED**: Authorization vulnerability in GET endpoints - now properly secured with ownership verification
- **✓ Good**: JWT authentication properly implemented across all sensitive operations  
- **✓ Good**: Input validation prevents injection attacks and malformed data
- **✓ Good**: Proper error handling without information leakage

### Performance Considerations
- **✓ Excellent**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing via foreign keys
- **✓ Good**: Frontend validation reduces unnecessary API calls
- **✓ Good**: Form state management minimizes re-renders
- **Recommendation**: Consider implementing pagination for events with many ticket types/zones (future enhancement)

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Backend Tests**: Comprehensive DTO validation tests covering all edge cases and constraints
- **Frontend Tests**: Component tests verify form behavior, validation, and accessibility  
- **Integration**: Service layer tests ensure proper API communication and error handling
- **Missing**: End-to-end tests for complete user flow (acceptable for this story scope)

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary**: This is a high-quality implementation that demonstrates senior-level engineering practices. The comprehensive feature set includes excellent validation, security, accessibility, and user experience. The two critical issues found during review have been resolved. The code is production-ready and exceeds expectations for the story requirements.
