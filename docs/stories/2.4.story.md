# Story 2.4: Event Publishing & Status Management

## Status
done

## Story
**As an** event organizer,
**I want** to publish a draft event to make it live, and later be able to unpublish it or pause registrations,
**so that** I have full control over my event's visibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An organizer can change an event's status from "draft" to "published".
2. Only "published" events are visible to the public.
3. An organizer can change a "published" event's status to "unpublished" (hiding it) or "paused" (visible but registration is closed).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 completion: Event creation with ticket types and seating configuration is fully functional. Multi-step form patterns established. Authorization patterns in place for event ownership verification. Comprehensive testing patterns established. UI/UX guidelines being followed with Chakra UI components and proper accessibility implementation.

### Tech Stack Requirements
Backend Technologies [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- TypeScript ~5.5 (primary language)
- NestJS ~10.3 (backend framework)
- TypeORM ~0.3 (ORM for PostgreSQL)
- PostgreSQL 16 (database)
- Jest & Supertest ~29.7 (testing)

Frontend Technologies [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- TypeScript ~5.5 (primary language)
- Expo (React Native) ~51.0 (framework)
- Chakra UI ~2.8 (UI component library)
- Zustand ~4.5 (state management)
- Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7 (testing)

### Data Models

Event Entity (Existing) [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  organizerId: string;
  categoryId: string;
  venueId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  location: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'ended' | 'paused';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Note: The data model already includes the status field with most required values. Need to verify if 'unpublished' status should be added or if 'draft' covers that use case.

Status Transition Business Logic:
- draft → published (initial publication)
- published → paused (pause registrations but keep visible)
- published → unpublished/draft (hide from public)
- paused → published (resume registrations)
- Any status → ended (when event concludes)

### API Specifications

Endpoint Patterns [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Base path: `/api/v1`
- Authentication: JWT Bearer token required
- RESTful design for resource management

Event Status Management Endpoints:
- PUT /api/v1/events/:eventId/status
- GET /api/v1/events/:eventId/status-history (optional audit trail)

Public Event Access Pattern:
- GET /api/v1/events (only returns published events)
- GET /api/v1/events/:eventId (returns event if published, or if user is owner)

### Backend Architecture Patterns

Controller Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
@Controller('events')
export class EventsController {
  @Put(':eventId/status')
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  async updateEventStatus(
    @Param('eventId') eventId: string,
    @Body() updateStatusDto: UpdateEventStatusDto,
    @Request() req
  ) {
    // Verify event ownership before updating status
    return this.eventsService.updateEventStatus(eventId, updateStatusDto.status, req.user.id);
  }
}
```

Service Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use Repository pattern with TypeORM
- Implement business logic for status transitions
- Verify event ownership in all operations
- Add audit trail for status changes

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

Component Structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// Status management component
const EventStatusManager = ({ eventId, currentStatus, onStatusChange }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [showConfirmation, setShowConfirmation] = useState(false);
  
  const handleStatusChange = async (newStatus) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      await eventStatusService.updateStatus(eventId, newStatus);
      onStatusChange(newStatus);
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error with proper user feedback
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <Box>
      <Select value={currentStatus} onChange={handleStatusChange}>
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
        <option value="paused">Paused</option>
        <option value="unpublished">Unpublished</option>
      </Select>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

State Management [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
- Use local component state for UI interactions
- Update global event store when status changes
- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on error

### UI/UX Requirements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-31
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Overall Quality: Excellent** - The implementation demonstrates strong architectural patterns, comprehensive error handling, and follows established coding standards. The developer has successfully implemented all requirements with clean, maintainable code that adheres to established patterns from previous stories.

**Key Strengths:**
- Proper separation of concerns with DTOs, services, and controllers
- Comprehensive validation using class-validator decorators
- Strong type safety throughout with TypeScript interfaces from shared-types
- Excellent test coverage across all layers (unit, integration, component)
- Proper authorization patterns ensuring only event owners can manage status
- Well-designed React component with accessibility features and responsive design
- Clear API design following RESTful principles

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: apps/server/src/features/events/events.service.ts:258-289
  - **Change**: Improved status change audit trail from array to Map-based storage for better performance
  - **Why**: Original implementation used a flat array which would have poor performance with many events
  - **How**: Changed to Map<string, EventStatusChangeDto[]> for O(1) event lookup and better memory organization

- **File**: apps/server/src/features/events/events.service.ts:176-206  
  - **Change**: Enhanced status transition validation with detailed error messages
  - **Why**: Original validation only returned boolean, making debugging difficult for users
  - **How**: Updated to return validation object with specific error messages explaining valid transitions

- **File**: apps/server/src/features/events/events.service.ts:208-230
  - **Change**: Updated updateEventStatus to use improved validation
  - **Why**: Better error messages improve user experience and debugging
  - **How**: Now uses detailed validation response for more informative BadRequestException messages

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows TypeScript patterns, proper naming conventions, and error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ **Perfect** - All files placed correctly according to unified-project-structure.md guidance  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Unit tests, integration tests, and component tests all present with good coverage
