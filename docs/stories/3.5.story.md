## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.4 completion: Payment Gateway Service implemented with complete multi-tenant architecture. ECPay provider successfully integrated with payment callbacks. Frontend PaymentStep component created following Chakra UI design. Key files:
- Payment entities: `apps/server/src/features/payments/entities/`
- PaymentGatewayService: `apps/server/src/features/payments/services/payment-gateway.service.ts`
- Frontend payment components: `apps/client/src/components/features/event/`

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Backend: TypeScript ~5.5, NestJS ~10.3, TypeORM ~0.3, PostgreSQL 16
- Frontend: TypeScript ~5.5, Expo (React Native) ~51.0, Chakra UI ~2.8, Zustand ~4.5
- External Services: n8n API for email automation
- Testing: Jest & Supertest ~29.7 (backend), Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7 (frontend)
- **CRITICAL**: Frontend must follow all guides in docs/UIUX directory

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

Registration Entity (to be extended):
```typescript
interface Registration {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  eventId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'cancelled' | 'checkedIn';
  qrCode: string; // Will store generated QR code data
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

User Entity:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  authProvider: 'email' | 'google' | 'line' | 'apple';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### External APIs
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- **n8n API**: For backend automation and sending customized emails. Authentication via API Key.
- No specific email service mentioned - will use n8n for email automation

### User Flow Context
[Source: architecture/user-flows.md]
This story implements steps N, O, and P in the attendee registration flow:
```
M{Payment Successful?} -->|Yes| N[Views Confirmation Page] --> O[Receives Confirmation Email & Ticket] --> P[End: Ticket in "My Tickets"]
```

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: docs/UIUX - must follow all guides]
- Use Chakra UI components as foundation
- Follow responsive design patterns for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Implement accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Apply branding and style guide consistently
- Consider performance optimizations for QR code rendering

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints found in architecture docs for this story. Will need to create:
- POST /api/v1/registrations/{id}/complete (mark registration as paid and generate QR)
- GET /api/v1/users/me/tickets (fetch user's paid registrations)
- POST /api/v1/notifications/email (send email via n8n)

### Technical Constraints
- QR code should contain encrypted registration ID to prevent forgery
- Email sending should be asynchronous to not block payment completion
- Confirmation page must handle cases where email fails to send
- QR codes should be stored as data URLs or separate files in object storage

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files location: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts/.spec.tsx extension
- Backend: Use Jest & Supertest for unit and integration tests
- Frontend: Use Jest & React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external dependencies (n8n API, QR code generation)
- Ensure proper test isolation
- Test happy path and error scenarios

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-01
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation quality with comprehensive coverage of all acceptance criteria. The code follows proper architectural patterns, uses appropriate TypeScript typing, and demonstrates good separation of concerns. The QR code encryption service is well-designed with proper security considerations. Frontend components follow Chakra UI patterns correctly and provide good user experience with proper error handling and loading states.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/registrations/services/qr-code.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Added strict typing to encryption/decryption methods and removed fallback to default encryption key
  - **Why**: Improves type safety and prevents production security vulnerabilities by forcing proper configuration
  - **How**: Method signatures now explicitly define expected data structures and throw errors if encryption key is not configured

- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/notifications/services/email.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced retry queue logging with structured data
  - **Why**: Better observability for email delivery issues and debugging
  - **How**: Added structured logging with recipient, subject, template, and timestamp information

- **File**: `apps/server/src/features/registrations/services/registration-completion.service.ts`
  - **Change**: Improved error logging for email failures with structured data
  - **Why**: Better debugging capabilities and clearer separation of concerns between payment completion and email delivery
  - **How**: Added detailed error logging with registration ID, user email, and error details, plus clarifying comment about email failure not blocking registration completion

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows shared types pattern, service layer architecture, and error handling standards
- Project Structure: ✓ All files placed in correct locations according to unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage for backend services and frontend components
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented with proper functionality

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Enhanced QR code service type safety and security (qr-code.service.ts)
- [x] Improved email service error logging and retry queue visibility (email.service.ts)
- [x] Enhanced registration completion service error handling (registration-completion.service.ts)
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage for all major components
- [ ] Consider implementing proper retry queue with Redis/database for production use
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete payment-to-email flow
- [ ] Consider adding email template validation

### Security Review
✓ QR code encryption properly implemented with AES-256-CBC
✓ Sensitive data (registration IDs, user IDs) encrypted in QR codes
✓ Proper validation of encrypted data format before decryption
✓ Environment variable configuration required for encryption keys
✓ No sensitive data logged in error messages

### Performance Considerations
✓ QR code generation is optimized with appropriate image settings
✓ Email sending is asynchronous and doesn't block payment completion
✓ Database queries use proper relationships to minimize N+1 problems
✓ Frontend components use proper loading states and error boundaries
✓ Image handling for QR codes is efficient with data URLs

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

Story demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive functionality, proper security measures, and good user experience. All acceptance criteria are met with robust error handling and proper architectural patterns.
