# Story 4.2: QR Code Scanning & Validation

## Status
done

## Story
**As an** event organizer,
**I want** to scan an attendee's QR code to validate their ticket instantly,
**so that** the check-in process is fast and efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The in-app scanner correctly reads the QR codes generated for tickets.
2. Upon a successful scan of a valid ticket, the screen displays a clear "Success" message with attendee details (e.g., name, ticket type).
3. The system prevents the same ticket from being checked in more than once, showing a clear "Already Checked In" error.
4. Scanning an invalid or non-existent QR code results in a "Ticket Not Found" error.
5. Each successful scan updates the attendee's status to "checked-in" in the database in real-time.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement QR code scanning functionality using existing camera service (AC: 1)
  - [x] Extend CameraScanner component to handle QR code detection
  - [x] Add QR code parsing and data extraction logic
  - [x] Implement barcode scanning configuration for expo-camera
- [x] Create QR code validation API endpoint (AC: 1, 4, 5)
  - [x] Add POST /api/v1/events/{eventId}/checkin endpoint
  - [x] Implement QR code decryption and validation logic
  - [x] Add database lookup for registration verification
  - [x] Update registration status to 'checkedIn' upon successful validation
- [x] Implement check-in status validation (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Add duplicate check-in prevention logic
  - [x] Implement real-time status validation before processing
  - [x] Return appropriate error messages for already checked-in tickets
- [x] Create success and error feedback UI (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Design and implement success modal with attendee details
  - [x] Create error modal for "Already Checked In" scenarios
  - [x] Create error modal for "Ticket Not Found" scenarios
  - [x] Add visual feedback for scanning states (processing, success, error)

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: docs/UIUX - must follow all guides]
- Use Chakra UI components for consistent modal designs
- Follow responsive design patterns for various device sizes
- Implement accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- Apply consistent branding and style guide for success/error states
- Use proper loading states and error handling patterns
- Provide clear visual feedback for scan results
- Ensure modals are optimized for mobile viewing during check-in operations

### QR Code Integration
[Source: existing QR code service at apps/server/src/features/registrations/services/qr-code.service.ts]
- QR codes contain encrypted registration data with type: 'registration'
- Decryption service validates data structure and timestamp
- QR format includes registration ID, user ID, event ID, and expiration timestamp
- Existing validation includes timestamp expiration checks for security

### Technical Constraints
- QR code validation must be real-time (under 500ms response time)
- Prevent race conditions for simultaneous check-ins of same ticket
- Implement proper error handling for network connectivity issues
- Scan feedback must be immediately visible to organizer
- Database updates must be atomic to prevent inconsistent states
- UI must work efficiently in venue lighting conditions

### External Dependencies Required
- expo-camera: Already installed for QR/barcode scanning
- expo-barcode-scanner: For enhanced barcode detection (if needed)
- Backend: JWT authentication for secure API access

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files location: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts/.spec.tsx extension
- Frontend: Use Jest & React Testing Library for component tests
- Backend: Use Jest & Supertest for API endpoint tests
- Mock QR code data and camera functionality for testing
- Test all validation scenarios (valid, invalid, duplicate, expired)
- Test error states and network failure scenarios
- Test UI accessibility with screen readers

### Test Scenarios
- Valid QR code scan with successful check-in
- Duplicate QR code scan prevention
- Invalid/malformed QR code handling
- Expired QR code validation
- Network error during validation
- Database error scenarios
- UI modal interactions and accessibility
