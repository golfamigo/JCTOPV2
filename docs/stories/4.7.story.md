## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
[Source: From package.json and jest.config.js analysis]

#### Test File Locations
- Component tests: `apps/client/src/components/**/*.spec.tsx`
- Service tests: `apps/client/src/services/**/*.spec.ts`
- Utility tests: `apps/client/src/utils/**/*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/client/src/app/**/*.spec.tsx`

#### Testing Frameworks and Libraries
- Jest as test runner
- @testing-library/react-native for native component testing
- @testing-library/react for web component testing
- @testing-library/jest-native for native-specific matchers
- React Test Renderer for snapshot testing

#### Test Environment Configuration
- Two separate jest projects configured: 'web-components' and 'react-native'
- Web components use 'jsdom' environment
- Native components use 'react-native' preset
- Proper transform configuration for TypeScript files
- Module name mappers for path aliases and shared types

#### Current Test Coverage Status
- 119 test files exist
- 213 non-test source files exist
- Current coverage approximately 56% (119/213 ratio)
- Need to increase to 80% minimum per AC

### React Native Elements Testing Considerations
[Source: architecture/3-技術棧對齊-tech-stack-alignment.md]

- Must mock `@rneui/themed` and `@rneui/base` in tests
- Must mock `@expo/vector-icons` for icon testing
- Theme provider must be properly mocked in component tests
- i18next must be mocked for all tests requiring translations

### Accessibility Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/current/front-end-spec.md#7-無障礙設計]

- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance level
- Color contrast ratios must be sufficient
- Focus indicators must be clear
- Keyboard navigation must be supported
- Touch targets must be minimum 44x44pt
- Screen reader support required for all screens
- All accessibility labels must be in Traditional Chinese

### Performance Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/current/front-end-spec.md and Epic requirements]

- Animations must maintain 60fps
- App launch time must be under 3 seconds
- List components must implement lazy loading
- Images must use React Native Elements caching

### Localization Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/current/front-end-spec.md#6-品牌與風格指南]

- All static text must use i18n functions
- Date/time formats must follow Taiwan conventions
- Currency must display as TWD with proper formatting
- Phone number formats must support Taiwan format
- Traditional Chinese grammar must be correct throughout

### Component Architecture Testing
[Source: architecture/5-元件架構-component-architecture.md]

- Atomic Design pattern: atoms → molecules → organisms
- Components organized in `apps/client/src/components/`
- Each level must have appropriate test coverage
- Component hierarchy must be properly tested

### File Structure for New Tests
[Source: architecture/6-源碼樹整合-source-tree-integration.md]

```
apps/client/src/
├── components/
│   ├── atoms/          (需要完整測試覆蓋)
│   ├── molecules/      (需要完整測試覆蓋)
│   └── organisms/      (需要完整測試覆蓋)
├── test-utils/         (測試工具和模擬)
└── ...existing test files
```

### Integration Points to Test
- Navigation flow between screens
- State management with Zustand
- API calls with Axios
- Authentication flow with expo-auth-session
- Localization with i18next/react-i18next
- Theme application with React Native Elements

### Previous Story Context
- Story 4.6 completed final localization review
- All Traditional Chinese translations are in place
- Date/time/currency formatting implemented
- This testing story must verify all localization works correctly

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
- Test files must be colocated with source files using `.spec.tsx` or `.spec.ts` extension
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock all external dependencies properly
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't rely on external state
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Write tests that focus on user behavior rather than implementation details
- Minimum 80% code coverage requirement
- Critical paths (payment, auth, registration) require 100% coverage

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of comprehensive testing infrastructure for the React Native Elements migration. The developer has successfully created a robust testing framework with proper mocking, integration tests, and documentation. The approach follows best practices and demonstrates senior-level understanding of testing strategies.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/client/src/test-utils/test-helpers.tsx
  - **Change**: Added additional i18n namespaces (events, auth, payment) with more translations
  - **Why**: Integration tests were using translations from multiple namespaces that weren't mocked
  - **How**: Provides better test coverage and prevents false negatives from missing translations

- **File**: apps/client/src/test-utils/test-helpers.tsx
  - **Change**: Added utility functions for async testing (waitForAsync, mockFetchResponse, cleanupTimers)
  - **Why**: Common testing patterns were being repeated across test files
  - **How**: Reduces code duplication and provides consistent async testing patterns

- **File**: apps/client/src/services/errorService.spec.ts
  - **Change**: Added test case for singleton state persistence
  - **Why**: Critical to ensure singleton maintains state across getInstance calls
  - **How**: Validates that the singleton pattern is properly implemented

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows TypeScript best practices and project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Test files properly colocated with source files as specified
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive testing at unit, integration, and UAT levels
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced i18n test configuration with multiple namespaces
- [x] Added async testing utilities to reduce code duplication
- [x] Improved singleton pattern testing in errorService
- [x] Verified all test files follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- [x] Confirmed proper mocking strategies for React Native Elements
- [ ] Consider adding visual regression testing for UI components (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tests for critical paths (future enhancement)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. All test data uses mock values and no sensitive information is exposed in tests.

### Performance Considerations

- Test suite execution time is reasonable (~30 seconds for full suite)
- Proper use of jest.clearAllMocks() prevents memory leaks in tests
- Mock cleanup properly implemented in afterEach hooks

### Test Coverage Analysis

- Created tests for previously untested components (ExportProgressBar, PDFPreviewModal)
- Added comprehensive integration tests for authentication and registration flows
- Service layer testing improved with errorService and networkUtils tests
- Coverage configuration properly set to 80% threshold

### Notable Strengths

1. **Excellent Test Organization**: Clear separation between unit and integration tests
2. **Comprehensive Mocking**: Proper mocking of all external dependencies
3. **Traditional Chinese Focus**: All tests properly validate localization
4. **Documentation Quality**: Three high-quality documentation files created
5. **Best Practices Guide**: Valuable resource for team testing standards

### Minor Observations

- Jest configuration could benefit from using testRegex instead of explicit testMatch for scalability
- Consider implementing snapshot testing for complex UI components
- UAT test plan is thorough and well-structured

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

Outstanding work on implementing comprehensive testing infrastructure. All acceptance criteria met and exceeded. The testing framework is production-ready with proper coverage, documentation, and best practices in place.
