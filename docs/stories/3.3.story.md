### UI/UX Requirements

Component Design [Source: docs/UIUX/component-library-design-system.md]:
- Use Chakra UI components as foundation
- Extend with custom styling following design system
- Use StepIndicator component for multi-step registration process

Color Palette [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Primary #2563EB: Main buttons, form controls, discount validation success
- Secondary #475569: Secondary text, borders, field labels
- Success #10B981: Valid discount code feedback, form validation success
- Error #EF4444: Invalid discount code warnings, form validation errors
- Neutral colors (#F8FAFC, #E2E8F0, #64748B, #0F172A): Backgrounds, borders, text

Typography [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Font families: Inter for Latin, Noto Sans TC for Traditional Chinese
- H3: 24px Semi-Bold (600), Line height 1.3 for section headers
- Body: 16px Normal (400), Line height 1.5 for field labels and descriptions
- Small: 14px Normal (400), Line height 1.5 for field validation messages

Layout & Spacing [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Follow 4-pixel grid system
- Use Feather Icons for consistent iconography (checkmark for valid discount, x for invalid)

Responsiveness [Source: docs/UIUX/responsiveness-strategy.md]:
- Mobile (320px): Single column layout, full-width form fields
- Tablet (768px): Optimized form layout with appropriate field sizing
- Desktop (1024px): Enhanced layout with proper form spacing
- Wide (1440px): Maintained readability with maximum form width

Accessibility [Source: docs/UIUX/accessibility-requirements.md]:
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance required
- Proper ARIA labels for all form fields and validation messages
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility for dynamic field rendering
- High contrast ratios for text and form elements
- Focus indicators for all form inputs
- Clear error messages for discount code validation
- Proper form field associations with labels

### Registration Flow Context

User Flow Integration [Source: docs/UIUX/user-flows.md]:
This story implements steps I and J in the attendee registration flow:
```
H[Selects Ticket Type & Quantity] → I[Fills out Registration Form] → J[Applies Discount Code (Optional)]
```

Step Indicator Component [Source: docs/UIUX/component-library-design-system.md]:
- Use existing StepIndicator component for multi-step registration process
- This is Step 2: Registration Form & Discount Code
- Previous step: Ticket Selection (3.2)
- Next step: Payment Information

### API Client Pattern

Service Layer Integration [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Frontend must only interact with API through service layer
- Use shared types from packages/shared-types  
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

Registration Service (to be created):
```typescript
export const registrationService = {
  async getCustomFields(eventId: string): Promise<CustomRegistrationField[]> {
    const response = await apiClient.get(`/events/${eventId}/registration-fields`);
    return response.data.fields;
  },
  
  async validateDiscountCode(eventId: string, code: string, totalAmount: number): Promise<DiscountValidationResponse> {
    const response = await apiClient.post(`/events/${eventId}/validate-discount`, { code, totalAmount });
    return response.data;
  }
};
```

### Dynamic Form Rendering

Field Type Rendering Patterns:
```typescript
const DynamicFieldRenderer = ({ field, value, onChange, error }) => {
  switch (field.fieldType) {
    case 'text':
      return <Input placeholder={field.placeholder} value={value} onChange={onChange} isInvalid={!!error} />;
    case 'email':
      return <Input type="email" placeholder={field.placeholder} value={value} onChange={onChange} isInvalid={!!error} />;
    case 'select':
      return (
        <Select placeholder={field.placeholder} value={value} onChange={onChange} isInvalid={!!error}>
          {field.options?.map((option) => (
            <option key={option} value={option}>{option}</option>
          ))}
        </Select>
      );
    case 'checkbox':
      return <Checkbox isChecked={value} onChange={onChange}>{field.label}</Checkbox>;
    case 'textarea':
      return <Textarea placeholder={field.placeholder} value={value} onChange={onChange} isInvalid={!!error} />;
    case 'number':
      return <NumberInput value={value} onChange={onChange}><NumberInputField isInvalid={!!error} /></NumberInput>;
    default:
      return null;
  }
};
```

### Database Schema Extensions

Custom Registration Fields Table (to be created):
```sql
CREATE TABLE "custom_registration_fields" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  "event_id" UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES "events"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "field_name" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  "field_type" VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  "label" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  "placeholder" VARCHAR(255),
  "required" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  "options" JSONB,
  "validation_rules" JSONB,
  "order" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  "created_at" TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  "updated_at" TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX ON "custom_registration_fields" ("event_id");
CREATE INDEX ON "custom_registration_fields" ("event_id", "order");
```
