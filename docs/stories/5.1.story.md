### Completion Notes
- Partially completed - significant progress made
- Fixed 18+ major components by completely rewriting them to React Native
- Components fixed include: 
  - CheckInModeScreen, CameraScanner, CheckInSuccessModal, CheckInErrorModal
  - AttendeeSearchForm, AttendeeSearchResults
  - GoogleSignInButton
  - DiscountCodeCard, DiscountCodeForm, DiscountCodeList
  - EventManagement (complete rewrite with tabs)
- All fixed components now use proper React Native patterns with @rneui/themed
- Removed all Chakra UI imports from fixed components
- TypeScript errors reduced from 1157 → 995 → 856 → 806 → 775 → 624 → 535 → 377 → 328 → 2 → 282 → 167 → 119 → 98 (1059 errors fixed total, 91.5% reduction)
- PaymentProviderCredentialsForm completely rewritten to remove all Chakra UI
- RegistrationConfirmationPage completely rewritten to use React Native components
- No more Chakra UI imports found, but some files still have web UI patterns (VStack, HStack, Box, etc.)
- Tests not re-run after latest batch of fixes
- Additional components fixed in continuation session (12 total components fully migrated)
- All incorrect @rneui/themed imports have been removed
- No more Chakra UI or web-specific UI patterns found in imports

### Remaining Work Required
1. **Type Definitions**: 535 TypeScript errors remain (mostly type mismatches, not UI patterns)
2. **Test Updates**: 351 failing tests need fixes after component migrations
3. **Navigation**: Some components may still have incorrect navigation patterns
4. **Platform-specific fixes**: Some components may need platform-specific adjustments

### Recommendation
This story requires splitting into smaller tasks due to the extensive scope. Suggest creating separate stories for:
- Story 5.2: Complete CheckInModeScreen and related components migration
- Story 5.3: Fix remaining TypeScript errors and type definitions
- Story 5.4: Update all failing tests after migrations
- Story 5.5: Complete removal of all web-specific UI patterns

### Change Log
- Replaced react-router-dom with @react-navigation/native
- Fixed theme color consistency issues
- Fixed API client import/export pattern
- Removed web-specific libraries from package.json

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to unify the frontend architecture to consistently use React Native with Expo across all platforms,
**so that** we have a maintainable codebase without mixed web/mobile libraries and all TypeScript errors are resolved.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All routing uses `@react-navigation/native` and `expo-router` (no `react-router-dom`)
2. All UI components use `@rneui/themed` (no Chakra UI or other web-only libraries)
3. TypeScript compilation passes without errors (`npm run type-check` succeeds)
4. All unit tests pass (`npm test` succeeds)
5. Theme colors are consistent across all components (no `danger` vs `error` conflicts)
6. API client imports/exports are properly structured

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Update `ForgotPasswordForm.spec.tsx` mock

  - [x] Remove `@chakra-ui` packages from package.json

  - [ ] Fix payment-settings.tsx incorrect imports
  - [ ] Ensure all UI uses `@rneui/themed` components
  - [ ] Remove any Material-UI or other web-specific UI library references
- [x] Fix theme color inconsistencies (AC: 5)
  - [x] Define `danger` as alias for `error` in theme or replace all uses
  - [x] Add missing color definitions (`lightGrey`, `text`, etc.) to theme
  - [x] Update all components to use consistent color names from theme
  - [x] Create theme type definitions for proper TypeScript support
- [x] Fix API client import/export issues (AC: 6)
  - [x] Update imports in `attendeeSearchService.ts` and `checkinService.ts`
  - [x] Ensure consistent import pattern across all services
  - [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for API responses
- [ ] Fix other TypeScript errors (AC: 3)
  - [x] Fix CameraType enum usage in `cameraService.ts`
  - [ ] Add proper types for report service responses
  - [ ] Fix HeadersInit type issues in `attendeeService.ts`
  - [ ] Resolve all remaining TypeScript compilation errors (98 errors remaining, down from 1157 - 91.5% reduction)
- [ ] Platform-specific code cleanup (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Review and standardize `Platform.OS` usage
  - [ ] Remove any `.web.tsx` or `.native.tsx` file splits if present
  - [ ] Ensure platform differences are handled consistently
- [ ] Final validation (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Run `npm run type-check` and ensure it passes
  - [ ] Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix any linting issues
  - [ ] Test app on web, iOS simulator, and Android emulator

## Technical Notes
- Use `@react-navigation/native` with `expo-router` for all navigation
- Use `@rneui/themed` for all UI components
- Handle platform differences with `Platform.select()` or `Platform.OS`
- Maintain single codebase for all platforms (web, iOS, Android)

## Dependencies
- Must be completed before any new feature development
- Blocks proper CI/CD setup due to TypeScript errors

## Estimation
- **Effort**: 12 story points
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Priority**: High (Technical Debt)
