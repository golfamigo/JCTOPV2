# Story 2.5: Public Event List & Discovery Page

## Status
done

## Story
**As an** attendee,
**I want** to view a list of all available events,
**so that** I can discover activities I'm interested in.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An API endpoint exists to fetch all "published" events.

  id: string;
  organizerId: string;
  categoryId: string;
  venueId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  location: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'ended' | 'paused';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Category Entity [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface Category {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  color: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Venue Entity [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface Venue {

  name: string;
  address: string;
  city: string;
  capacity: number;
  description: string;
  createdAt: Date;

```

### API Specifications

Endpoint Patterns [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Base path: `/api/v1`
- RESTful design for resource management
- Pagination support via query parameters

Public Events Endpoint:
- GET /api/v1/events
- Query parameters: page (default: 1), limit (default: 10)
- Response format:
```typescript
interface PaginatedEventsResponse {
  data: Event[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
}
```

Filter Logic:
- Only return events with status='published'
- Include related entities (category, venue, ticketTypes)
- Sort by startDate ascending by default

### Backend Architecture Patterns

Controller Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
@Controller('events')
export class EventsController {
  @Get()
  async findPublicEvents(
    @Query('page') page: number = 1,
    @Query('limit') limit: number = 10
  ) {
    return this.eventsService.findPublicEvents(page, limit);
  }
}
```

Service Pattern [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use Repository pattern with TypeORM
- Include pagination logic
- Filter by published status
- Include related entities in response
- Handle edge cases for invalid pagination

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

Component Structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// EventCard component structure
const EventCard = ({ event, onFavorite }) => {
  return (
    <Box borderWidth={1} borderRadius="lg" overflow="hidden">
      <Image src={event.imageUrl} alt={event.title} />
      <Box p={4}>
        <Heading size="md">{event.title}</Heading>
        <Text color="gray.600">{formatDate(event.startDate)}</Text>
        <Text color="gray.600">{event.location}</Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg" fontWeight="bold" color="primary.500">
          From ${getMinPrice(event.ticketTypes)}
        </Text>
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

Service Layer [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// eventService extension
async getPublicEvents(page: number = 1, limit: number = 10): Promise<PaginatedEventsResponse> {
  const response = await apiClient.get(`/events?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`);
  return response.data;
}
```

State Management [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
- Use local component state for UI interactions
- Implement loading states for data fetching
- Handle pagination state in parent component

### UI/UX Requirements

Component Design [Source: docs/UIUX/component-library-design-system.md]:
- EventCard: Display event summary in lists and grids
- Use Chakra UI components as foundation
- Extend with custom styling following design system

Color Palette [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Primary #2563EB: Main buttons, links, active elements
- Secondary #475569: Secondary text, borders, UI accents
- Success #10B981: Positive feedback, confirmations
- Neutral colors (#F8FAFC, #E2E8F0, #64748B, #0F172A): Backgrounds, borders, text

Typography [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Font families: Inter for Latin, Noto Sans TC for Traditional Chinese
- H1: 36px Bold (700), Line height 1.2
- H3: 24px Semi-Bold (600), Line height 1.3  
- Body: 16px Normal (400), Line height 1.5
- Small: 14px Normal (400), Line height 1.5

Layout & Spacing [Source: docs/UIUX/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Follow 4-pixel grid system
- Use Feather Icons for consistent iconography

Responsiveness [Source: docs/UIUX/responsiveness-strategy.md]:
- Mobile (320px): Single column card layout
- Tablet (768px): 2-column grid layout
- Desktop (1024px): 3-column grid layout
- Wide (1440px): 4-column grid layout

EventCard Responsive Design:
- Mobile: Full width cards with vertical image
- Tablet: 2 cards per row with square images
- Desktop: 3 cards per row with aspect ratio optimization

Accessibility [Source: docs/UIUX/accessibility-requirements.md]:
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance required
- Proper ARIA labels for event cards and pagination
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility for event information
- High contrast ratios for text and background
- Focus indicators for navigation elements
- Alternative text for event images

Performance Considerations:
- Page load within 3 seconds
- Interaction response under 500ms
- Smooth 60 FPS for animations
- Lazy loading for event images
- Skeleton screens during data loading

### API Client Pattern

- Use skeleton screens for loading states
- Optimize bundle size with proper code splitting
- Maintain smooth scrolling and interactions

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Test File Locations [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Backend: Same directory as source file with .spec.ts extension
- Frontend: Same directory as component with .spec.tsx extension

Testing Frameworks:
- Backend: Jest & Supertest for unit and integration tests
- Frontend: Jest & React Testing Library for component tests

Testing Patterns:
- Mock external dependencies
- Test happy path and error cases
- Test edge cases and validation
- Ensure proper test isolation

Specific Testing Requirements:
- Test public events API endpoint with pagination
- Test EventCard component with various event data
- Test EventsList page rendering and interactions
- Test pagination component functionality
- Test responsive behavior at all breakpoints
