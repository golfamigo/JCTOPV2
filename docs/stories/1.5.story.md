## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: Email/password registration system will be implemented with bcrypt password hashing, User entity exists with email uniqueness validation. From Story 1.3: PostgreSQL database connection established, User table exists with UUID primary keys. NestJS backend has features-based module structure with TypeORM repository pattern.

### Tech Stack Requirements
Technologies [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Frontend**: TypeScript ~5.5, Expo (React Native) ~51.0, Chakra UI ~2.8, Zustand ~4.5
- **Backend**: TypeScript ~5.5, NestJS ~10.3, Passport.js ~0.7 for authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with existing User table
- **Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library ~29.7 (frontend), Jest & Supertest ~29.7 (backend)

### Authentication Architecture
JWT Login Flow [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FE as Frontend App
    participant BE as Backend API
    participant DB as Database

    FE->>BE: POST /auth/login (email, password)
    BE->>DB: Find user by email
    DB-->>BE: Return user with password hash
    BE->>BE: Compare provided password with hash
    alt Credentials Valid
        BE->>BE: Generate JWT (with userId)
        BE-->>FE: Return JWT
    else Credentials Invalid
        BE-->>FE: Return 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

JWT Auth Guard [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {}
```

### Data Models
User Interface [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  authProvider: 'email' | 'google' | 'line' | 'apple';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

    └── apiClient.ts               <- Updated with JWT header support
```

### State Management
Auth Store Pattern [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// authStore manages user authentication state, token, and user profile
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  login: (credentials: LoginData) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
}
```

### API Client Configuration
API Client with JWT [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// src/services/apiClient.ts
import axios from 'axios';
import { useAuthStore } from '../stores/authStore';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api/v1',
});

apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = useAuthStore.getState().token;
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

### Technical Constraints
JWT Authentication Requirements:
- Must use Passport.js ~0.7 with JWT strategy
- JWT tokens should include user ID and expire appropriately
- Password verification must use bcrypt (consistent with registration)
- Must protect routes using JWT auth guards
- Frontend must store JWT securely using AsyncStorage
- Token refresh logic needed for expired tokens
- Follow existing User entity and authProvider field logic

### Coding Standards
Critical Rules [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Type Sharing**: Use existing User interface from `packages/shared-types`
- **API Calls**: Frontend must interact with API through dedicated service layer
- **Environment Variables**: Access JWT secrets through configuration module
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use standard error handling middleware

### Testing
Unit Tests Required [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Backend Tests**: Login endpoint validation, JWT generation, password verification, auth guards
- **Frontend Tests**: LoginForm component, authStore state management, API client JWT handling
- **Integration Tests**: Complete login flow from form submission to authenticated state

Test File Locations:
- `apps/server/src/features/auth/auth.service.spec.ts` - Login and JWT tests
- `apps/server/src/features/auth/auth.controller.spec.ts` - Login endpoint tests
- `apps/server/src/features/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.spec.ts` - Auth guard tests
- `apps/client/src/components/features/auth/LoginForm.spec.tsx` - Login form tests
- `apps/client/src/stores/authStore.spec.ts` - Auth state management tests

### Environment Configuration
JWT Configuration:
```bash
# Backend (apps/server/.env)
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/jctop_event"

# Frontend (apps/client/.env)
API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/v1"
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-30
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The login and session management implementation demonstrates solid engineering fundamentals with comprehensive JWT authentication flow. The developer has successfully implemented all required components with proper separation of concerns, TypeScript type safety, and extensive test coverage. The architecture follows established patterns with NestJS backend using Passport JWT strategy and React Native frontend with Zustand state management.

### Refactoring Performed
**File**: apps/server/src/features/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts:27
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded fallback JWT secret
- **Why**: Security vulnerability - fallback secrets in production are dangerous
- **How**: Forces proper environment variable configuration, prevents accidental use of default secrets

**File**: apps/server/src/features/auth/auth.module.ts:18
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded fallback JWT secret from module configuration
- **Why**: Consistent security hardening across JWT configuration
- **How**: Ensures all JWT operations use environment-based secrets

**File**: apps/client/src/stores/authStore.ts
- **Change**: Implemented JWT token expiration validation in loadAuthState method
- **Why**: The TODO comment indicated missing token validation, which is critical for security
- **How**: Added isTokenExpired helper method that parses JWT payload and validates expiration timestamp

**File**: apps/client/src/services/apiClient.ts
- **Change**: Enhanced token validation in getAuthToken method and improved auth error handling
- **Why**: Proactive token expiration checking prevents unnecessary API calls with expired tokens
- **How**: Integrated with authStore's token validation and automatic logout on expiration

### Compliance Check
