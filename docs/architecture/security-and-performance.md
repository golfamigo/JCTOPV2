# Security and Performance

### Security Requirements

  * **Frontend**: Session tokens will be stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies or secure on-device storage.
  * **Backend**: All input will be validated using NestJS's `ValidationPipe`, a strict CORS policy will be enforced, and APIs will be rate-limited.
  * **Authentication**: Strong password policies will be enforced, and all data will be encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (hashed passwords).

### Performance Optimization

  * **Frontend**: Code-splitting via Expo Router will be used to ensure fast initial load times.
  * **Backend**: Proper indexing will be used on the PostgreSQL database, and a caching layer with Redis will be implemented for frequently accessed data.
